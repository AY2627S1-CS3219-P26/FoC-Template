## Friend on Campus (Relay)

**Friend on Campus (FoC)**, shown as **Relay** in the app, is a peer-to-peer campus errand platform. Students request items to be collected from stores or facilities on campus, and other students fulfil and deliver those requests. The platform runs on a closed credit economy: credits cannot be bought, withdrawn or exchanged for money, and only circulate within the platform.

Live deployment: <https://relay.54-254-126-243.sslip.io> (only while the cloud instance is running, see [Deployment](#deployment)).

## Architecture

| Component | Responsibility | Stack | Data store |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`user-service`](user-service/README.md) | Accounts, email verification, sessions, roles; the only authority on authorization | Node.js, TypeScript, Express | MongoDB |
| [`supplier-service`](supplier-service/README.md) | Catalogue of campus stores, facilities and landmarks; walking routes from a supplier to a drop-off point on a map of the NUS area (N2H) | Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify | PostgreSQL |
| [`order-service`](order-service/README.md) | Errand requests and their lifecycle | Node.js, TypeScript, Express | PostgreSQL |
| [`credit-service`](credit-service/README.md) | Credit balances, reservations and transfers | Node.js, TypeScript, Express | MongoDB (replica set) |
| [`recommendation-service`](recommendation-service/README.md) | Suggests a credit reward for a new errand from completed ones (N2H) | Node.js, TypeScript, Express | in-memory feature store |
| [`message-service`](message-service/README.md) | Direct messages between accounts, live over Socket.IO (N2H) | Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Socket.IO | MongoDB |
| [`rag-service`](rag-service/README.md) | Help assistant that answers from the help documents with Claude (N2H) | Python, FastAPI | in-memory FAISS index |
| [`web-client`](web-client/README.md) | Browser app (React) and the gateway in front of every service (nginx) | React, Vite, nginx | none |

- **Gateway:** the browser only talks to the web client, which forwards `/api/<service>/...` to the services. No service is reachable from outside directly ([ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-web-client-gateway.md)).
- **Authorization:** every service asks the user-service (`POST /internal/authorize`) on each protected request and refuses when it gets no clear yes ([ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-server-side-sessions.md)).
- **Events:** services announce changes asynchronously through RabbitMQ, published through an outbox and consumed idempotently. Conventions and the event catalog are in [`docs/events.md`](docs/events.md) ([ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-message-broker.md)).
- **Database per service:** each service owns its database; no other service reads it.

## Running locally

Requires only Docker. From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Component | URL |
| --- | --- |
| The app (web-client and gateway) | <http://localhost:8080> |
| user-service | <http://localhost:3001> |
| supplier-service | <http://localhost:3002> |
| order-service | <http://localhost:3003> |
| credit-service | <http://localhost:3004> |
| recommendation-service | <http://localhost:3006> |
| message-service | <http://localhost:3008> |
| rag-service | <http://localhost:3080> |
| Mailpit, catches every email locally | <http://localhost:8025> |
| RabbitMQ management UI (user `relay`, password `change-me`) | <http://localhost:15672> |origin/dev

No `.env` is needed: every variable has a development default in `compose.yaml`. The first administrator is `admin` with the password `change-me`. To override a value, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The help assistant needs a Claude API key in `CLAUDE_API_KEY`; without it the rest of the system works as usual.

`docker compose down -v` stops everything and deletes the local data. How to work on a single service, run its tests or develop the client with live reload is in that service's README.

---

## Deployment

The same Helm chart ([`deploy/helm/relay`](deploy/helm/relay)) and the same images run on a laptop and in the cloud; only the values files differ.

- **Local Kubernetes:** `deploy/scripts/local-up.sh` builds the images and installs the chart into a k3d cluster (<http://localhost:8081>).
- **Cloud:** one EC2 instance with k3s in AWS Singapore, created with Terraform ([`deploy/terraform`](deploy/terraform)). HTTPS through Traefik and cert-manager, horizontal autoscaling per service.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions tests every pull request and publishes the images to GHCR on every merge into `dev` or `main`. A merge into `dev` is also rolled out to the running cloud instance. `deploy/scripts/cloud.sh start | stop | status` switches the instance on and off.

Setup, secrets, network rules and autoscaling are described in [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md), the reasons in [ADR 0004](docs/decisions/0004-cloud-deployment.md).

---

## Development workflow

Work is tracked in Linear (team `REL`); every backlog requirement is an issue there. Branches are cut from `dev` as `<type>/rel-<n>-<description>` and come back through a pull request into `dev`; `main` holds the submitted milestones. Conventions are in [`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md), the rules for coding agents in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

---

## Repository structure

One folder per service at the top level. A nice-to-have feature that warrants its own service gets another folder at the same level.

```text
.
├── user-service/
├── supplier-service/
├── order-service/
├── credit-service/
├── message-service/      N2H
├── rag-service/          N2H
├── web-client/           browser app and gateway
├── deploy/               Helm chart, Terraform, deploy scripts
├── docs/                 decisions (ADRs), events, deployment, workflow
├── data/                 seed data for the supplier catalogue
├── postman/              API collections for manual testing
└── compose.yaml          the whole system for local development
```

`web-client/` has no `-service` suffix on purpose: it owns no bounded context, no data store and no domain API. It is a peer deployable, not a peer service.
