# message-service

Direct messages between Relay accounts. Messages are saved in MongoDB and delivered live over Socket.IO. Every new account gets a welcome message from Relay, triggered by the `user.account.activated` event.

Node.js 24, TypeScript, Express 5, Socket.IO, MongoDB (Mongoose), RabbitMQ (amqplib)

## Running

From the repository root, `docker compose up --build` starts the service on http://localhost:3008 together with its database (`message-db`, published on `127.0.0.1:27018`). It needs the user-service for every protected request, and the broker for welcome messages. Without the broker the service still runs and keeps trying to connect.

Outside Docker: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then `npm run dev`.

The browser reaches the service through the web client gateway: REST under `/api/message/messages/...`, Socket.IO on the path `/api/message/socket.io`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | HTTP and Socket.IO port (default 3008) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | pino log level (default `info`) |
| `MONGO_URL` | MongoDB connection string |
| `USER_SERVICE_URL` | Base URL of the user-service, for `POST /internal/authorize` |
| `BROKER_URL` | RabbitMQ connection string, for consuming events |

## Authorization

Every request under `/messages` and every socket connection carries the `relay_session` cookie. The service asks the user-service (`POST /internal/authorize`, role `member`) whether it belongs to a logged-in account, and uses only the `accountId` from that answer. Ids in a request body or event payload never decide who the sender is.

It fails closed: no answer, a timeout (2 s) or anything other than `authorized` is a refusal. Sockets are checked when they connect and again for every event they send.

## API

All errors have the shape `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "details": { ... } } }`. Validation errors list every invalid field in `details.fields`.

| Method | Path | Access | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | public | `200 {status:"ok",db:"up"}`, or `503` while the database is down |
| GET | `/messages/conversations` | member | One row per person the caller has written with, newest first |
| GET | `/messages/last-message/:userId` | member | The newest message between the caller and `userId`, or `null` |
| GET | `/messages/:senderId/:receiverId?page=&pageSize=` | participant | One page of the conversation |
| POST | `/messages/send` | member | Saves a message, `201` with the message |

A refusal is `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` without a cookie and `403 FORBIDDEN` otherwise. Reading a conversation you are not part of is refused before anything is looked up, so the answer does not reveal whether it exists.

A message:

```json
{
  "_id": "6728a1f3c9e77b0012345678",
  "senderId": "1268c530-68bf-4a64-ae18-6884f0931741",
  "receiverId": "eeb4e173-feec-4d64-bed0-b6b42e7eaf4f",
  "content": "I can pick up your coffee",
  "status": "unread",
  "createdAt": "2026-11-06T05:07:12.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-11-06T05:07:12.000Z"
}
```

`GET /messages/conversations` returns `[{ "otherId": "...", "lastMessage": <message>, "unread": 2 }]`, where `unread` counts the messages to the caller that are still unread. Messages from Relay have `senderId` `"0"`.

`GET /messages/:senderId/:receiverId` returns `{ "items": [...], "page": 1, "pageSize": 20, "total": 27 }`. Page 1 holds the newest messages, and the items inside a page are oldest first, ready to show. `page` starts at 1, `pageSize` is 1 to 100 (default 20). The two ids can be given in either order.

`POST /messages/send` takes `{ "receiverId": "...", "content": "..." }`. `content` must not be empty, and `receiverId` must not be `"0"`.

## Socket events

Connect with `io({ path: "/api/message/socket.io" })` through the gateway. Each socket joins a room named after its account, so a message reaches every open tab of the receiver.

| Direction | Event | Payload | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| client → server | `sendMessage` | `{ receiverId, content }` | ack with the saved message, or `{ error: { code, message } }` |
| client → server | `markAsRead` | `{ senderId }` | ack `{ changed }`, the number of messages marked read |
| client → server | `heartbeat` | none | emits `heartbeat:ack { timestamp }` |
| server → client | `receiveMessage` | a message | sent to the receiver |
| server → client | `messagesRead` | `{ readerId }` | sent to the sender, only when `markAsRead` changed something |

A connection without a valid session is refused with the error `FORBIDDEN`. If the session ends while connected, the next event is refused and the socket is disconnected.

## Events

Consumed from the exchange `relay.events` on the queue `message-service.messages`:

| Event | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `user.account.activated` | Saves a welcome message from Relay (`senderId` `"0"`) to `data.accountId` and pushes it to the account if it is online |

The broker delivers at least once. A partial unique index on `receiverId` for messages from Relay makes a repeated event a no-op, so every account gets exactly one welcome message. An event is acknowledged only after the message is saved; a failed save is requeued after 5 seconds. A malformed event goes to `message-service.messages.dead`. The full catalog is in `../docs/events.md`.

## Tests

`npm test` runs the tests in `test/` against an in-memory MongoDB (the first run downloads it) and a fake user-service from `test/helpers/auth.ts`. They cover REST refusals, sending and reading, the socket events, and repeated welcome events.
