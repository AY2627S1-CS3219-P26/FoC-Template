# RAG Service

The help assistant for Friend on Campus (shown as Relay in the app). A logged-in user asks how to do something, the service finds the most relevant help documents, and Claude answers from those documents only. This is nice-to-have N2 of the brief.

## Setup

You need Docker Desktop and a Claude API key. Create a `.env` file in the repository root that sets `CLAUDE_API_KEY`, then start the assistant from the repository root. The user-service starts with it, because every question needs a login check.

```bash
docker compose up --build rag-service web-client
```

The embedding model is downloaded while the image is built, so the build needs internet access and a new container does not.

| Address | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| <http://localhost:8080/api/rag/query/> | The route the browser uses, through the gateway |
| <http://localhost:3080> | The service itself, reachable from your machine only |
| <http://localhost:3080/docs> | Generated API documentation |

Log in as the first administrator and ask a question. Each question uses your Claude credits.

```bash
curl -s -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/user/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"identifier":"admin","password":"change-me"}'
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rag/query/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"How do I post an errand?"}'
```

To work on the code, keep the user-service in Docker and run this service on your machine. It reads `rag-service/.env`, where `USER_SERVICE_URL` is `http://localhost:3001`.

```bash
docker compose up -d user-service
cd rag-service
uv sync
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 3080
```

### Tests

Two tests check that a question retrieves the right help document. They need neither a Claude key nor the other services, and they cost nothing. The first run downloads the embedding model if it is not on your machine yet.

```bash
cd rag-service
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## API

### `POST /query/`

Needs a logged-in session in the `relay_session` cookie. From the browser the path is `/api/rag/query/`. The final slash is required, and the gateway answers 404 without it.

```json
{
  "query": "What if nobody accepts my errand?",
  "conversation": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "How do I post an errand?" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "Open Post an errand from the menu..." }
  ]
}
```

`query` is required and holds 1 to 1000 characters. `conversation` is optional and holds the earlier turns, because the service stores nothing between requests. Each turn is `user` or `assistant` with at most 6000 characters, and only the last 10 turns are used.

The answer is `200`:

```json
{ "query": "What if nobody accepts my errand?", "response": "It expires, and your reserved credits are released..." }
```

Errors have the shape `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`:

| Status | Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `INVALID_QUERY` | The question is blank or longer than 1000 characters. |
| 400 | `INVALID_CONVERSATION` | A turn has another role, is not text or is too long. |
| 401 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | There is no session cookie. |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | The session is not valid, or the user-service could not be reached. |
| 500 | `ASSISTANT_FAILED` | The answer failed, for example because Claude could not be reached. The cause is in the service log. |

A body with a missing or wrongly typed field gets FastAPI's own `422` response, which does not use this shape.

### Public routes

`GET /`, `GET /health/`, `GET /docs` and `GET /openapi.json` need no login. The gateway does not forward them, so the browser cannot reach them.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Yes | The key for calling Claude. Keep it out of git. The service starts with an empty key, but every question then fails. |
| `USER_SERVICE_URL` | Yes | Where the user-service is. Compose sets it to `http://user-service:3000`. The service does not start without it. |
| `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` | No | Set to `1` in the image, so the service uses the built-in model and never tries to download one. |

The web client reads `RAG_SERVICE_URL` to find this service. Compose sets it to `http://rag-service:3080`. The port is fixed at 3080 in the `Dockerfile`, so the `PORT` value in `compose.yaml` is not used.

## Design

```text
Browser -> web-client gateway -> auth middleware -> user-service (POST /internal/authorize)
                                       |
                                       v
                                  controller (limits)
                                       |
                                       v
                                  rag_service: embed question -> FAISS: 2 closest documents
                                       |
                                       v
                                  Claude answers from those documents
```

- **Help documents:** `src/data/` holds one short `.txt` file per topic. Each starts with a `Title:` line and a `Questions:` line that lists how people ask about the topic, which helps the search find it.
- **Short documents:** the embedding model only reads the first 256 tokens of a text, so a long document would be partly ignored. Keep each file short and about one topic.
- **Search:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` turns text into vectors on the CPU, and a FAISS `IndexFlatL2` finds the 2 closest documents. With this few documents, an exact search in memory is fast enough, so no database is needed. The index is built at startup, which takes a few seconds.
- **Model in the image:** this makes the image self-contained, so startup needs no download and one image works locally and in the cloud. The cost is a larger image of about 2 GB.
- **Login:** the user-service decides who may ask, as for every other service. The middleware checks every path that is not listed as public, so a new route is protected by default. It fails closed: if the user-service does not answer `authorized`, the request is refused.
- **Cost limits:** everything in a request is sent to Claude, so the limits on `query`, `conversation` and `max_tokens` also limit what one request can cost.
- **No stored state:** the service keeps no conversations and no database. The client sends the earlier turns with each question.

### What is sent to Claude

Each question sends the question, the earlier turns and the 2 retrieved documents to the Anthropic API. The account id, the session cookie and other account data are not sent. Whatever a user types is sent as written, so users should not enter personal data in the assistant.

## Updating the help documents

1. Add or edit a `.txt` file in `src/data/`, with the `Title:` and `Questions:` lines first.
2. Rebuild the service, because the documents are read at startup and are part of the image: `docker compose up --build -d rag-service`.
3. Ask a few questions about the topic and run the tests.

## Third-party software

The service uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) and the [Anthropic Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python). The full list is in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

## Declaration of AI-assisted work

I used Claude Code while building this service. I decided what the service should do, wrote its first version and reviewed the results.
